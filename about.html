            <h1>About this site</h1>
            <p>This site was made as the capstone project for the <a
                    href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">Web Design Specialization</a> on
                Coursera. It was made using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

            <h2>The project</h2>
            <p>
                The idea behind is from an abandoned game project of mine, a basic roguelike where the main character
                gets their powers from the constellations. The project started a bit different before becoming this
                version, with my initial idea to do a moon-themed exploration and sandbox game, which later turned into
                an action game, where you jump through moons and planets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally this final version was concepted, with constellations being an easy source of inspiration for
                powers (there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_designated_constellations">list of them on
                    Wikipedia</a>) and the roguelike being a genre I love to play, with great
                replayability and experimentation with the powers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I prototyped some mechanics from all those versions, such as terrain generation and a skill system, but
                ultimately couldn't continue with the project. This site was a way to revive it and to turn the
                project into something I could publish.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Bandana. I have a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering and always had a focus in the
                programming areas. I have learnt from various areas of software development, like embedded software with
                C, data science with Python, games with Unity and web applications with Flutter and Node.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently venturing into new areas for me, focusing on front-end development in the programming side
                but also learning drawing, pixel art, and doing other crafts when I have time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a strong passion for games in general and all the art within, with a special love for the indies.
                I always end up diving into game wikis reading all the details about the story, places and characters,
                learning all the references and inspirations from the real world, and how that turned into their own
                universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my main inspiration when creating something, including this project. I want to make those mini
                universes, with their own set of characters, rules and relations. And one day be part of something big
                enough that people will also dive in its universe for hours.
            </p>
